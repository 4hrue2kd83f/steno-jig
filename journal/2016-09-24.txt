Day 34 - 24:05
==============

Took two days off.

Still doing the first 40 common briefs from Learn Plover along with the
1- and 2-key words, the three-key consonant-vowel-consonant words, and
the single-syllable DBLMN- or -NM words.

15:00 - 36 WPM w/20 errors (96%).

Felt good, but as usual I started getting sloppy after the first five
minutes or so.
