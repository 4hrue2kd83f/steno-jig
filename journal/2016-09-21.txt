Day 33 - 23:20
==============

15:00 - 1&2 key, 1-syl CVC, DBLFMN- and -NM words @35WPM w/18 errors (96%).

15:00 - added Learn Plover's common briefs 1-40: 29 WPM w/12 errors (97%).

Well, that doesn't count me correcting the first time or two for some of
the briefs when I had to guess the stroke.

15:00 - 31 WPM w/13 errors (97%).

That felt pretty good. I'm still a little shaky on the briefs, but all
the rest is pretty comfortable.
