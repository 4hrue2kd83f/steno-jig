Day 16 - 10:12
==============

- 5:00 Single-syllable QYVJ-words @ 25 WPM.
- 10:00 Single-syllable DBL-, FMN-, and QYVJ- words @ 23 WPM.
- 3:00 Single-syllable words with all consonants so far @ 27 WPM.

Hmm...it's scrolling backwards sometimes.  Need to fix that.

- 15:00 All words @ 23 WPM.

I really need to analyze the Plover dictionary.  Making these word-lists
by hand is annoying.  I just want to be able to say: "give me all the
phonetically-spelled words that use these pseudo-steno consonants."
It's not *too* bad grepping for matching strokes and then walking
through and taking out the ones which are briefs, but if I want to drill
combinations...there will be a combinatorial explosion of pieces needed.
Or maybe it's easier that way because each piece is small enough to
quickly look through by hand...?  But it would sure be nice to just
requist the ones I want and have them automagically found.

Starting to mock up some keyboard design in SketchUp.  I think 2.1 mm of
travel will be fine (3 times 0.7mm of switch travel).  My laptop
keyboard is less than 2mm, and it's perfectly comfortable. It's much
heavier though: about 70 grams, judging by the 27-28 pennies I have to
pile on a key in order to depress it.  I wonder if it will be *too*
light?  The switches come in 0.74 N (75.5g force) and 1.30 N (132.5g
force).  I was thinking of using the lighter ones, but that brings
us in at 25g activation force.  The heavier ones would come in at 44g.
Which would probably be fine.  Josh Lifton [says][1] he and Mirabai both
independently chose the 35g switches from a bunch of prototypes that
Matias sent them.  That's about halfway in between...

Hmm.  I could get to 30g with the lighter switch and a 2.5:1 lever arm
(1.75mm throw).  Or 35 with about a 3.75:1 arm and the heavier switch
(giving a 2.6mm throw).  Yeah...it only makes a few millimeters
difference in the length of the levers.  Interesting.  As you get more
leverage, the small ones are longer, but the increment between sizes is
less.

The heavier switch with 35g force and 2.6mm throw might be really nice.
I think I'll try that first.  That's split at about 1.9mm travel to the
activation point and 0.7mm over-travel.

I have Northfield rehearsal tonight, so I just one more exercise and
I'll have to call it quits for the day.

- 15:00 all words so far @ 24 WPM.

48:00 today, 11:00 total.
