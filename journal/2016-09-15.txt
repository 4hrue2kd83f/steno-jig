Day 27 - 18:35
==============

15:00 1&2 key, 1-syl CVC, DBL- and -N words @ 34 WPM w/28 errors (94% accuracy).

Bleh.

15:00 1&2 key, 1-syl CVC, DBL- and -N words @ 34 WPM w/17 errors (96% accuracy).

OK, that's coming back.  If I put in two more careful 15-minute runs
today I should be there.

I got a countdown timer added.  And I think I finished getting all the
basic items added to the steno-to-pseudosteno translator.  And...it
looks like first-longest is good enough for now.  So next I need to go
through and mark the canonical strokes.  The next coding task is to
divide pseudo-steno into individual sounds and write filtering code to
select words which require only the currently-known sounds.

15:00 1&2 key, 1-syl CVC, DBL- and -N words @ 30 WPM w/16 errors (96% accuracy).

Well... *maybe* I'll be there.

15:00 1&2 key, 1-syl CVC, DBL- and -N words @ 33 WPM w/14 errors (97% accuracy).

Nope, not quite.  Still need a third fewer errors (9 at that speed).  Oh
well, maybe tomorrow.

Gah.  I'm going to have one more try.  Accuracy this time.

15:00 1&2 key, 1-syl CVC, DBL- and -N words @ 33 WPM w/10 errors (97.9% accuracy).

Yeah, that's better.  *Just* missed it.

So...I was looking up and it seems like the professional touch typing
places suggest that with efficient study, you can be typing 15-20 WPM in
10 hours of study, and up to 35-45 WPM in about 30 hours.

Considering that I took a five-week break, and that before the break I
had almost all of the basic sounds...I don't think steno is all *that*
much slower to learn.  Maybe not even twice if you were really
disciplined and had a good course of study?
