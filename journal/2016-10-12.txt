Day 46 - 30:00
==============

Ooops. Skipped a day *again* yesterday. Was kinda crunching on
trying to get networked play working on our collaborative game
prototype so we could look at it on our video chat last night
(since Michael is going south for two weeks leaving today). I
didn't get it done, either. I went down a blind alley and didn't
manage to straighten things out in time. Oh well.

15:00 - Number sentences (w/punctuation from now on) @ 27 WPM.

Starting to feel pretty darn good. I'm mixing up B- and D- again,
also W- and K- on a few words. So I need to work on that.
