Day 10 - 4:37
=============

- 4:27 Three-letter words @ 21 WPM w/7 mis-strokes.
- 5:09 Three-letter words @ 18 WPM w/3 mis-strokes.
- 4:51 Three-letter words @ 19 WPM w/2 mis-strokes.
- 5:13 Three-letter words @ 18 WPM w/5 mis-strokes.
- 5:39 Three-letter words @ 16 WPM w/10 mis-strokes.
- 5:44 Three-letter words @ 16 WPM w/4 mis-strokes.

That's correcting for the two or three mis-strokes I made due to
inadequate rollover on my laptop keyboard.  I'm starting to get it
memorized which ones conflict, but...also I don't want to get *too* far
into bad habits that I'll have to correct later on.  I think it will be
reasonably easy to fix when I get my Zalman keyboard (supposedly in two
days).

It definitely helps to move/feel the chord and give it a double-check
before I actually hit it.  And...I think 30 minutes is too long.  I
should probably try four 15-minute sessions a day instead of two
30-minute ones.

- 5:34 Three-letter words @ 17 WPM w/10 mis-strokes.

Hmm... I think I ran up against something weird in Plover there: I kept
stroking TEL and it kept spitting out "tel" instead of "tell".  Very
odd.  But then I banged some nonsense and removed it and then it finally
worked.

- 5:43 Three-letter words @ 16 WPM w/13 mis-strokes.
- 5:44 Three-letter words @ 16 WPM w/3 mis-strokes.
- 5:45 Three-letter words @ 16 WPM w/5 mis-strokes.
- 6:16 Three-letter words @ 16 WPM w/5 mis-strokes.

And...it's definitely helpful to stroke them as a chord rather than
rolling them.  Those last two were pressing and holding the chord, and
then rolling the other keys if I hear the beep which says that it missed
a key.  So until my Zalman comes, I think I should either find a
customizable drill program (so I can remove the words which conflict),
or go back to drilling two-character chords.
