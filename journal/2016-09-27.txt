Day 37 - 25:45
==============

Hmm...I don't really *have* more word sets to add except the uncommon
consonants on the left side (QYJV).  So for the moment I just added the
multi-stroke 3-key consonant-vowel-consonant words back in.

15:00 - 31 WPM w/20 errors (95%).

I did *incredibly* badly at the beginning. So once I steadied down
that's probably a reasonable accuracy.
