Day 47 - 30:15
==============

15:00 - Number sentences @ 30 WPM.

I really need to work the other vowels.  The few that I put in
there (because I wanted a particular tense of a verb or whatever)
are surprisingly tricky. I usually get "wear" OK, but I had to try
*several* times with "meet" before I realised that I was writing
OI instead of EE as the vowel. Otherwise, I'm very happy with how
it's going.

Though also I need to put more time into it...so sloppy lately.
But I've buckled down on the game project and I *think* I should
get it up and running tonight, and then it can go back to
consuming a more reasonable portion of my spare time.

15:00 - 1-syl DBLFMNQYQV- and -MN words and common briefs 1-40 @ 34 WPM.

15:00 - Number sentences @ 38 WPM.

Cruising right along! Sweet!

And I wrote this last bit in Plover, and it took me less than 11
minutes. So that's not bad at all.
