Day 41 - 27:15
==============

10:00 - Number sentences @ 15 WPM w/4 uncorrected errors (97%).

This morning I banged together some random sentence generation for
number drill. It's fun, so I posted it to the Plover steno group
and to the Discord chat. I'm also getting about to the point where
I can almost type on this thing. For instance, I typed most of
this paragraph using Plover, and it only took me 9 minutes. 9
minutes. Heh. Oh well. I'll get better.

9:00 - Free typing.

11:00 - Number sentences @ 18 WPM w/4 uncorrected errors (95%).

15:00 - Number sentences @ 18 WPM w/8 uncorrected errors (97%).

Of course there were many more errors than that, but I think most of
them were overlaps where you have to stroke the suffix separately. And
numbers, of course. But I'm not being too worried about those since I'm
still learning them. Maybe I should do this in stages? Start with single
digits, then maybe non-inverted. Oh, I could probably put the doubled
numbers in there. And then add the inverted ones. Oh well, tomorrow.

0:45 today, 28:00 total.
