15:00 - 1&2 key words and single-stroke CVC @ 33 WPM.

Yeah, this is starting to require less thought.  Tempting to speed up,
but I'm still nowhere near perfect yet, so I probably shouldn't.  And I
can definitely see a few words that I've learned wrong and it's a real
pain.  So I should stay slow and get more accurate so I can drill
accurately.  I know that from piano.  It may feel slow, but it's
actually much faster to learn this way...

Still.  Wonder if I could make a small wordlist (couple thousand words
or something?) and make that nonsense sentence generator to make this
more interesting.  What's today?  Monday.  Yeah, maybe this evening I'll
work on that.

15:00 - 1&2 key words and single-stroke CVC @34 WPM.

And better accuracy, I think.  Very cool.  Starting to be able to stroke
a lot of things without having to think about it.  And again, the ones
that are trouble are ones that I *know* are trouble and I've trained my
fingers to do them wrong.  Grr.  Need to be ever more careful.

15:00 - 1&2 key words and single-stroke CVC @ 33 WPM.

With about 1.2 errors per minute or about one error every 27 strokes.
Not *awful*, but should definitely be better.
