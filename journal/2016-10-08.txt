Day 43 - 28:15
==============

Skipped four days there, the Maine Game Dev guys decided to do a
collaborative project and I've been crunching on trying to get
that started. Still, I don't seem to have lost anything. The
glories of good practice...

15:00 - Number sentences @ 24 WPM

15:00 - Number sentences @ 26 WPM

Yeah, that's starting to feel pretty comfortable. I bet by
Thanksgiving I'll be able to use Plover for normal everyday
typing.

15:00 - Typing that last bit in Vim.

15:00 - Number sentences @ 26 WPM.

Yup. It's coming along. After recording the second practice of the
day and writing those two sentences in Plover, I realized that I
need some practice in punctuation and common words.  I'll have to
start putting some exercises together. My hope was to demonstrate
that it's similar to learning a normal keyboard layout: that you
can get to be basically comfortable typing at 35-40 WPM with 40
hours of practice. If I do an hour a day that's only another 11
days, so I need to get cracking. Am I three-quarters of the way
there? Hmm. It's hard to say, but I suspect I am.

1:00 today, 29:15 total.
