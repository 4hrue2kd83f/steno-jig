Day 50 - 33:45
==============

15:00 - Top 100 words @ 31 WPM w/97% accuracy.

There are a couple of words in there that I should either work on or
remove. Probably I should work on them, even though they shouldn't
really be in the top 100. It will be useful later to know the sounds.

15:00 - Top 100 words @34 WPM w/97% accuracy.

15:00 - Top 100 words @37 WPM w/95% accuracy.

Not bad. Fun to go fast, but as usual it's not sustainable. Need
to keep it slow and accurate.

15:00 - Top 100 words @37 WPM w/94% accuracy.

Yeah. See. It just screws up my accuracy. And I even thought I
*was* going slow that time. Bleh. Oh well. I only need two more
rounds of practice today, so I'll leave a big break and do them
before and after supper. And maybe I'll switch it up and do number
sentences or something instead.

15:00 - Number sentences @ 29 WPM w/94% accuracy.

Or...maybe this is just too much for one day? That was pathetic. Though
oddly enough it felt pretty good except for all the mistakes. Hrm. Well,
I just have one more for the day, so I'll do it later and be really
careful and we'll see how it goes.

15:00 - Top 100 words @ 37 WPM w/96% accuracy.

OK. Didn't manage to be as accurate as I wanted, but somehow got
faster while I was at it. Still, that's accurate enough to not
train in mistakes (much). Funny how much difference that 2% makes.

All told, a good day's progress.  Tomorrow I should learn some new
words.
