Picking This Up Again
---------------------

4 x 5:00 - single-syllable CVC @ 20-25 WPM

I really want to learn this, so whether I muddle through with the
default Plover dictionary or make my own from scratch, I need to
start practicing again.  So. I put in four 5-minute sets of CVC
chords (one finger each on left/vowel/right). Ran from 20-25 words
per minute, with various error rates.  I was hoping I had drilled
the keys in better than that, but I guess it could have been
worse.  It took me about two weeks and 8 or 10 hours to get to
that point in the first place.

10:00 - single-syllable CVC @ 27 WPM w/19 errors.

Ooof.  Gotta be more careful.

10:00 - single-syllable CVC 2 27 WPM w/30 errors.

Or...not.  OK, obviously I need more of a break than that.
