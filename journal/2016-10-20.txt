Day 53 - 38:30
==============

15:00 - Top 140 words @ 35 WPM w/95% accuracy.

Heh. Yes, Virginia, you still have to pay attention. Well. Good
enough. Let's move on to the next bunch.

Ugh. Those are awful and web-polluted.  Let's import the NGSL
words.  They're in a spreadsheet, it should be easy enough to
export as CSV and convert to JSON. And...I think I'll group them
all under the "lemma", and randomly choose a form.

-----

Yeah, that was easy enough to set up.

And yeah, there are a bunch of things in there that I haven't
learned yet. Also I learned that "many" is "MAEN" and that "MAIN"
is "main", but Plover doesn't have a dictionary stroke for "mane".

15:00 - NGSL Top 100 @ 11 WPM.

15:00 - NGSL Top 100 @ 20 WPM.

I spent a bunch of time moving all the default exercise code into
the TypeJig. And then I got chatting with Jason on Discord so I
posted it to GitHub for him. I think the next thing I want to
experiment with is a "next-stroke" display. I wonder if I can
just make a table and give the cells rounded corners?

-----

Oops. I ran out all my spare time today working on the steno jig
code, and didn't get ll my practice in. So 1:45 practice for these
three days will leave me a half-hour shy of 45 hours. Hmm. So how
about we add an extra day. That's there days of 1:30 and one day
of 1:15. And I can do the short day today so I can try to finish
up the stroke display and put in a bit of work on the game.

0:45 today, 39:15 total.
