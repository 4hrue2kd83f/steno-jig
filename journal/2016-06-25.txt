Day 13 - 7:43
=============

I got the scrolling code working.  What next?  I need the code to generate the
exercises, check the results, and manage the input field.  I think I'm going to
hold off on drilling and see if I can get this running in time to use for
today's practice.  Actually, today looks busy.  Let me do one section.

- 3:15 Three-letter words @ 29 WPM w/10 misstrokes.
- 3:17 Three-letter words @ 29 WPM w/6 misstrokes.

Ouch.  Must pay better attention.

- 3:11 Three-letter words @ 30 WPM w/3 misstrokes.
- 3:18 Three-letter words @ 29 WPM with perfect accuracy.
- 3:32 Three-letter words @ 27 WPM w/2 misstrokes.

16:33

Yeah...took all day to get the typing jig going.  I just did one run of
100 three-letter words.

- 3:54.  100 Three-letter words @ 26 WPM w/14 uncorrected errors.

Standard WPM (characters per minute divided by 5) was only 22.  I think
I'll use that from now on.

And it's almost 10 PM, so I'm going to bed now.  Eh.  Maybe one more.
See if I can do better.  Hah.  Nope.

- 3:31 - 100 three-letter words @ 24 WPM w/9 misstrokes.

I missed war, cat, pull, hop, wag, cur, pat, cull, and rut.

23:58 today, 8:07 total.
