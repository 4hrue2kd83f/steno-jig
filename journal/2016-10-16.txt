Day 49 - 32:05
==============

Oops. Had a really weird unproductive day yesterday and totally
forgot to practice my steno.

5:00 - Top 60 words @ 31 WPM.

Getting better at the weird ones that don't belong: page, search,
site. Definitely helping me focus on my other vowels. Still having
trouble remembering that "information" is N-FSHN.

10:00 - Top 60 words @ 33 WPM.

Yep. Stopping and focusing when I see one of the trouble words.
Also realized that I've been doing THAER for "their" and that's
probably a mis-stroke entry for THAEUR. So I should switch.

35:00 - The Door in the Wall: 1st two paragraphs (187 "words" @5 WPM)

5:00 - Number sentences @30WPM.

15:00 - Top 80 words @ 27 WPM.

Yeah. Much better if I go slower and get things right.

5:00 - Top words 61-80 @ 28 WPM.

5:00 - Top words 81-100 @ 26 WPM.

5:00 - Top words 61-100 @ 31 WPM.

15:00 - Top 100 words @ 33 WPM.

OK, new plan. If I do 1:30 a day for the next 4 days and then 1:45
for the following 3 days, that will bring me to 45 hours by the
end of next Sunday. That's 50% more than you need to get to 40 WPM
with a good quality touch-typing course. So let's work hard on
vocabulary for the next week and see if I can get to the point
where I can use it for basic typing.

So on Friday we go up to 1:45.

1:40 today, 33:45 total.
