Hmm...it's still remembering errors that have been corrected.  I thought
I fixed that.  Oh...it's not removing the error if you backspace it,
only if you go from correct to incorrect.  Which...is that even
possible?  Oh well, it's fixed now.

Ideally I would track the errors made for purposes of finding patterns,
but wouldn't use corrected errors for calculating adjusted WPM.  Also it
would be good to report "pet instead of put" and that sort of thing.

Also it might be to scrolling unnecessarily at the end of the input.

-----

I updated it so you can run an exercise for a period of time.  And I
added the one- and two-key words.

- 15:00 - one-, two-, and three-key words @ 21 WPM w/16 errors.

Hmm...it should report the final word count...?  379 words.
