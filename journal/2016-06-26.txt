Hmm...it's still remembering errors that have been corrected.  I thought
I fixed that.  Oh...it's not removing the error if you backspace it,
only if you go from correct to incorrect.  Which...is that even
possible?  Oh well, it's fixed now.

Ideally I would track the errors made for purposes of finding patterns,
but wouldn't use corrected errors for calculating adjusted WPM.  Also it
would be good to report "pet instead of put" and that sort of thing.

Also it might be to scrolling unnecessarily at the end of the input.

I updated it so you can run an exercise for a period of time.  And I
added the one- and two-key words.

- 15:00 - one-, two-, and three-key words @ 21 WPM w/16 errors.

Hmm...it should report the final word count...?  379 words.

Heh.  I grepped the dictionary and found all the words which are single
or multiple strokes of consonant, vowel, consonant.  That's fun but much
harder.

- 15:00 short + all CVC @ 13 WPM

Also I learned a few things.  Most obviously, the first stroke of a
multi-stroke word will always output something and it's usually not a
prefix of the word.  For instance, TOR/TUR gives "tour" and then
"torture".  So my error checking needs a lot of work.  And some strokes
may give multiple words, I think.  So I'm not quite sure how to handle
that.  For now maybe I'll refrain from recording a word until there's a
space after it?  But that's not great for regular typing.  Hrm.

The other thing is that a lot of the multi-stroke CVC words I found can
be stroked without a consonant on some syllables, but some need
consonants on both ends of the later syllables.  So for instance KAR/OT
and KAR/ROT both give "carrot", and the dictionary has the former one
first.  It makes sense that the one with fewer keys would be preferred.

But take POS/SES or POS/ES which both give "possess", but of the
things I tried only POS/SES/SOR gives "possessor" (POS/ES/OR gives
"possess or", while POS/ES/SOR gives possess sore).  Hmm.  And looking
at the dictionary gives a million options for possess.  The first one is
POE/SESZ, but there are a whole bunch of combinations of PO or POE or
POS with ES or SES or SESZ or even S*ESZ.  But *all* four of the
phonetic "possessor" forms require SES/SOR or SES/O*R.  And why not
SES/OR?  There isn't anything to conflict with it, so why use the
asterisk to denote an alternate form?  Oh, `O*R` is the "-or" suffix.

Yeah...now that I think about it, I've seen several posts on the google
group about the inconsistencies in the default dictionary.  Well, I
guess it mostly is just Mirabai's personal dictionary.

OK, one more set today.

- 15:00 short + all CVC @ 17 WPM.

64:37 today, 9:12 total.
