Day 3
=====

Aha.  [Qwerty Steno][] lets you drill individual keys.  Only the sets
they choose to give you, and they only display one word at a time, so
you can't see what's coming.  But it's all javascript, so I'll just
download the scripts and fix them to work in a less stupid fashion.
That should be much less work than trying to re-create things from
scratch.  Yay.  Don't know how I missed trying that one.

Still, even with the way it is, I got pretty comfortable with the vowels
in about 8 or 10 minutes.

OK, it only took an hour or two to display more drill items, and most of
that was figuring out the stupid web browser stuff so I could do a bit
of a transition instead of just popping items out of existence.  It's
still not great, but at least there's *some* visual indication that the
text is scrolling left.

I also entered a steno keyboard layout with checkboxes.  Now I need to
populate the drill data from those checkboxes, and I'll have a nice key
drilling page.

-----

Ah...sweet.  Got the checkboxes working, so now I can drill arbitrary
sets of keys.  Of course...it would be *really* cool to just give a
sequence in which keys should be introduced, and have it add them
one-by-one as your speed and accuracy reaching a threshold.  But that
would need error tracking and weighted probabilities, so it's probably
not worth coding right now.  Maybe someday.
