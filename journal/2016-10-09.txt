Day 44 - 29:15
==============

I added exclamation points, commas, and question marks to my
number sentences. That slowed me down a bit. Hmm. Maybe I should
add quotation marks as well: 9 pens said, "86 huts lug 28 nuts!"
But this is good practice.

15:00 - Number sentences w/punctuation @ 24 WPM.

Hrm. Now I basically know where they are, so I probably need to
slow down a bunch and do it nearly perfectly until I pick up
speed.

15:00 - Number sentences w/punctuation @ 22 WPM w/13 errors (96%).
