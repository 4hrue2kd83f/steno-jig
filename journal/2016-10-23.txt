Day 56 - 40:15
==============

OK. Gotta get back to work.

15:00 NGSL lexemes 100-120 @ 26 WPM.

I'm still correcting everything. Maybe one really slow session for
accuracy and then I can start reporting errors for these words.

Actually I'm thinking I should go back and drill more sound
combinations. I never really did the long vowels or dipthongs or
vowel disambiguators. What if I did a hand-made set of drills:
"car care, far fare", etc.? Or...I could put them together in a
word set and make an exercise type that does *all* alternatives
instead of a random one. Hmm. Actually that could be a parameter
to the exercise constructor: the name of a function to use. Random
alternative, root (first) alternative, ordered alternatives,
shuffled alternatives.

Yeah...and then I read an article about not hesitating and keeping
your fingers moving.

15:00 NGSL lexemes 100-120 @ 30 WPM.

OK, did a short-and-long A drill. Still need to add a bunch of them to
the translations dictionary. But that's much more fun. And definitely
needs work.

15:00 A/AY words @ 36 WPM.
