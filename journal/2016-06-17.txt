Day 5
=====

- 3:00 left hand fingers (STKPWHR) @ 70 SPM
- 4:00 left hand fingers (STKPWHR) @ 86 SPM
- 7:00 right fingers (FRPBLGTS) @ 81 SPM

OK, so I need to learn the right pinky reach keys ('D' and 'Z') and then
I'll know where everything is.

But putting them together is *much* harder.  5 minutes at 58 strokes per
minute, and it felt like more errors.  Maybe it would be easier if I put
them in order so it was always left/vowel/right?  Half the trouble is
differentiating between, say 'T' and '-T'.  Which hand do I use?

So try doing them one after the other and then generating strokes with
two or three keys?  Sounds like a plan to me.

But first, finish up the keys.  OK. One minute on the right pinky keys
(TSDZ) and then four minutes on the whole keyboard at 67 SPM.

So what's that, 24 minutes today?  And I had a bit over an hour before.
I think I'm pretty happy with that.  About an hour and a half total
drilling time (over four days) and I can hit all the keys reasonably
accurately at around a stroke per second.

That's probably all the time I'll have today since we're doing a big
batch of hay and we have to do some harvesting for weekend produce
orders and I'm responsible for cooking supper tonight.  Oh, and I was
supposed to seed a bed of lettuce a couple of days ago; I really need to
get that done today.
