Day 2

OK.  JavaScript thing for running typing exercises.  Basically a text
comparison routine.  But we want it to mark up the thing you're typing
and it needs to preserve the cursor position.  And ideally it shouldn't
change more than it needs to.

Note that it's *not* a full-fledged `diff` algorithm.  It only needs to
iterate through both trees and match up the text character by character.
So we need a tree iterator.  Ah, looks like there's a `NodeIterator`
object.

Gah.  Web browsers are such complete crap.  Well, I'm getting closer to
having a thing which will let you input text and mark up the errors.
Didn't do any real practice today though.
