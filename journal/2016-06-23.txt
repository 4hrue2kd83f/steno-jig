Day 11 - 5:40
=============

I checked the tracking and my Zalman keyboard is supposed to come today!
Cool.  I was expecting to have to wait another day.

All the careful practice yesterday is paying off: it feels much more
natural this morning.

- 5:05 Three-letter words @ 18 WPM w/5 mis-strokes.

And maybe 3 of those mis-strokes were rollover errors.  My system beeps
when you try to press a key that it can't detect properly, so instead of
trying to arpeggiate, I've been pressing and holding the chord.  Then if
I get a beep I'm holding the first key and rolling the others.

- 5:23 Three-letter words @17 WPM w/2 mis-strokes.

And...that was me failing to press firmly and bouncing off the first
key so I got two strokes instead of the one I wanted.  My fingers were
in the right place.  OK, one more time, and then maybe I'll work on my
own drill scripts (I did a bunch of planning on paper yesterday; maybe
I'll transcribe it here later) and wait for my keyboard to arrive.

- 5:31 Three-letter words @ 17 WPM w/2 mis-strokes.

And those were real mis-strokes this time, darn it.

-----

Aha!

- 4:54 Three-letter words @ 19 WPM w/1 mis-stroke.

And the mis-stroke was me slipping onto the -D from the -T, so not an
error in thinking, just a slight execution problem.  Sweet.  OK, *now* I
can wait.

And...it's here!  Hmm.  I've used a laptop keyboard for so long that I
forget normal keyboards are sloped. Or stepped, or terraced, or whatever
you want to call it.  So I don't think I'll be able to rest my fingers
directly on the gap.  I'll have to go up or down.  Let's try down first.

- 4:42 Three-letter words @ 20 WPM w/14 mis-strokes.

Yeah.  That's going to take some getting used to.  And the reach for 'Z'
feels longer as well, although 'D' is comfortable.  Weird.  Maybe I just
need to adjust my posture or home position?  And man, it has a lot of
travel.  And a heavier touch.  Well, maybe it's not heavier.  But it
feels mushier.  Maybe it's just the travel.

OK, let's try riding on the edges of the upper row.  That's closer to
centered than bumping into them from the bottom.  Hmm.  No, that makes
it really hard to hit both keys for each finger at once.  For that I
need to really be down a bit, but *almost* riding on the key.  Hrm.  Oh.
I guess it really is right over the crack.  Maybe if I hover a bit I can
hang out there.  Hmm...not really.  I'll have to figure something out.

- 4:04 Three-letter words @ 23 WPM w/13 mis-strokes.

OK, gotta buckle down and pay attention.

Wahoo!

- 3:46 Three-letter words @ 25 WPM w/2 mis-strokes.
- 3:42 Three-letter words @ 25 WPM w/7 mis-strokes.
- 3:38 Three-letter words @ 26 WPM w/3 mis-strokes.
- 3:34 Three-letter words @ 26 WPM w/1 mis-stroke.
- 3:39 Three-letter words @ 26 WPM w/5 mis-strokes.
- 3:30 Three-letter words @ 27 WPM with *NO* mis-strokes!!!
- 3:24 Three-letter words @ 28 WPM with 5 mis-strokes.

OK, two more and we're done for the day.  I think I'll take a break
first.

- 3:11 Three-letter words @ 30 WPM w/7 mis-strokes.
- 3:12 Three-letter words @ 30 WPM w/10 mis-strokes.

Yup, definitely time to quit for the night.
