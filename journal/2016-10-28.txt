Day 61 - 45:00
==============

10:00 - Common briefs 41-100 @ 34 WPM.

It's pretty amazing having the stroke hints. Though I still think
I'd like to have the pseudosteno as well: I almost have to put my
fingers there and then go, "oh, that's what the sounds are and why
it makes sense." Actually what I'd really like is to show the
pseudosteno on the keyboard, combining cells and color coding them
and updating the text.

Jason found some bugs and such, so I fixed a couple of things.

Sooty was talking on the Discord chat about being just shy of a
year with steno, and 100 WPM-ish, or up to 140 if feeling sharp
and knew all the words. So that got me thinking about where I'm
at. So. 45 hours, 60 days of practice. Averaging 45 minutes a day,
obviously.

I started off by practicing 20 days straight for a total of about
14 hours (say, 42 minutes per day average). That was from June
13th through July 2nd. Then I took 9+ weeks off (66 days?) and
didn't touch it again until September 7th. Since then I have
practiced 41 of 52 days (averaging 5.5 days per week), which was
three or four 2-4 day dead patches when I was busy with other
projects. Now that I'm making progress I've been better about it.
I'm on a 13-day streak right now.

10:00 Common briefs 1-100 @ 36 WPM.

10:00 Common briefs 1-100 @ 42 WPM.

Oh, man, I *like* the stroke hints. I'm trying to force myself to
look away (with some success). But I wonder if I need to. It might
well become automatic just through repetition.

Well, it's getting late. I'm going to call it a night.

0:30 today, 45:30 total.
