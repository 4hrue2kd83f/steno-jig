15:00 NGSL lexemes 100-120 @ 14 WPM.

Hrm. I'm not sure about some of these. Still, stills, stilled,
stilling, stiller, stillest. Yeah, I guess those are all OK. He
stills, she stilled, they were the stillest. They look so weird
out of context though. Though what about stilling? Well, if you
can use stills and stilled for the act of becoming motionless, I
guess you can use stilling for it as well. He looked out over the
stilling crowd. Unusual but probably legit.

The NGSL seems generally good, but it has some conversational
things like 'cos and gonna and such which I'm not sure really
belong, at least for beginners. I left most of them in, but took
out a couple which Plover didn't have. 'cos and shoulda, maybe? Or
just 'cos? Plover has gonna: it's the starred version of going.
