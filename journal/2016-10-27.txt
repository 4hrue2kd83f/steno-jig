Day 60 - 44:15
==============

12:00 - CVC words + briefs 1-40 @ 36 WPM w/37 errors (91%).

That was a very "meh, don't care" kind of practice. Can't do that...

Also, I forgot to switch the exercise back to 15 minute sessions.
So I guess I'll do two 9-minute ones to get back on track?

9:00 - CVC words + briefs 1-40 @ 42 WPM w/17 errors (95%).

That's a little better. And it probably would have been faster,
but a stupid fly landed on my monitor right on top of the text I
was trying to type...grr.

9:00 - CVC words + briefs 1-40 @ 42 WPM w/17 errors (95%).

Heh. Exactly the same.

Hrm. I did another 15 minutes last night and I could swear I wrote
it down, but apparently not. I think it was around 39 WPM and 95%
accuracy?

0:45 today, 45:00 total.
