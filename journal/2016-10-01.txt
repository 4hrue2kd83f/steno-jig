Day 40 - 26:45
==============

I missed another day yesterday. I've kind of out-run my exercises.
Also I spent all my spare time working on lever layout for the
Stenodactyl.  Also I'm wondering if I can skip the keys and just
make conductive silicon pads for the bottom of the levers.  It
sounds like you can do it just by mixing powdered graphite (which
you can get as a dry lubricant) into silicon caulk.  That would
save nearly $6 in electronic parts.

OK. So today I went back to everything, including the new JQVY-
words. It's feeling very comfortable but I still have to remember
not to get sloppy.  So maybe this is a good thing that I haven't
made more exercises. Really drill these things into my fingers.
