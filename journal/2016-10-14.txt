Day 48 - 31:40
==============

15:00 - Top 200 words @ 8 WPM.

And much, much, much looking up. I guess I should start with a very
small set and work my way up.

5:00 - Top 40 words @ 36 WPM.

Heh. Funny how much this is a *web* corpus: there's no way "home"
and "page" are really in the top 40.

5:00 - Top 60 words @ 25 WPM.

0:25 today, 32:05 total.
