Day 20 - 13:30
==============

20:00 Dusty and the Fiddlers.

Still not getting much easier.  Most of the guessing and lookup turns
out to be me not knowing how to break up syllables.  So I should have
done a bunch of drill on that.  Also I didn't drill the right hand "th",
"ch", and "sh".  Need to go back and do that.

Don't know how much time I'll put in today: this afternoon is the game
dev meeting.

20 today, 13:50 total.
