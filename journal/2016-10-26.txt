Day 59 - 42:45
==============

15:00 - CVC words + briefs 1-40 @ 32 WPM w/23 errors (95%).

Hrm. Having the multi-syllable CVC words in there makes it harder:
you have two chances to make an error and then you're likely to
mess up two or three words.

15:00 - CVC words + briefs 1-40 @ 26 WPM w/31 errors (94%).

Oy. I was doing very well (I think) and then I totally fell apart
in the last two minutes.

15:00 - CVC words + briefs 1-40 @ 34 WPM w/22 errors (95%).

There. Now we're climbing a little. I still fell apart a bit in
the last two or three minutes. But not as badly this time. And I
managed to keep the speed down to a pace where I didn't make so
many multi-word errors from screwing up multi-stroke words.

15:00 - CVC words + briefs 1-40 @ 39 WPM w/24 errors (95%).

Oh yeah. The end of that one was great. Cruising along at a very
nice speed. Maybe I should try some real text?

18:00 - 152 words of A Door in the Wall (over 8 WPM).

OK, that's getting better. I was even able to guess the strokes
for four or five words. I only had to resort to a dictionary
lookup for "whether", which only has a brief ("WHR"). Most of it
felt pretty good.

Hrm. I need 12 more minutes to even things up. Let's do a speed
run?

12:00 - CVC words + briefs 1-40 @ 43 WPM w/34 errors (93%).

Not too bad. And it felt nice and fast.

1:30 today, 44:15 total.
