Day 7
=====

- 8:00 Consonant-Vowel @ 37 SPM, creeping toward 40+ at the end.
- 7:00 Vowel-Consonant (first 5 @ 37 SPM, last 2 @41).

Hmm...I need to add some way to show the stroke.  It's really annoying
to make an error and not know how you screwed up.  You don't know if
your fingers have slipped off, or which key of the chord you screwed up,
or anything.  If you make two or more mis-strokes you can look at the
keyboard table to see which keys you're actually pressing, but for the
first mis-stroke I have always released it before I have a chance to
look.

- 5:00 Consonant-Vowel-Consonant @ 21 SPM.
- 2:00 Individual Keys @ 72 SPM
- 5:00 Consonant-Vowel-Consonant @ 21 SPM.

So... 27 minutes today brings us to 2:21 total.

- 9:00 Consonant-Vowel-Consonant @18 SPM.

Bleh.  I might have to go back and drill some old stuff.  Mostly I'm
mixing up 'K' and 'W', I think.  Also a few of these three-key chords
have rollover problems already.  Guess I'll have to get serious about
building some sort of keyboard.  Or maybe I should just break down and
get a Zalman K600S for now.

Yeah, let's do that.  OK, it's supposed to be here in 5 days, on the
24th.
