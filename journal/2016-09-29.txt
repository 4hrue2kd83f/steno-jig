Day 39 - 26:15
==============

15:00 - 1-syl QJYV- words @29 WPM w/22 errors (95%).

Not bad. And I'm starting early today, so maybe I'll actually get
an hour of practice in.

15:00 - 37 WPM w/19 errors (96%).

Oof. I take it back about key weight not mattering. This set is
pretty heavily slanted toward J- words, and that's definitely hard
on the left wrist and forearm on my Zalman K600S.
