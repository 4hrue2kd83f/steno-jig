Day 32 - 22:35
==============

15:00 1&2 key, 1-syl CVC, DBLFMN-, and -N words @35WPM w/25 errors (96%).

Not too bad.  But I definitely have a ways to go before moving on.
And...there are a few words in these sets that aren't in the CVC
pattern, and those are definitely harder to stroke.  So I need to find a
bunch of those to practice with...  Yeah, I definitely need a way to
auto-generate this stuff.

15:00 1&2 key, 1-syl CVC, DBLFMN-, and -MN words @35WPM w/15 errors (97%).

Sweet.  That felt really good.  I got a little tired/sloppy toward the
end.  Maybe I should go to 10-minute exercises?  But it really helped to
notice that some of my errors are when I let it go automatic and try to
hit the Dvorak key instead of the steno chord for a sound.

Not quite as good. But it's late, and I'm tired. I probably shouldn't have done another round, but that would have left me with just 30 minutes, and I wanted more than that. Sweet. I wrote this whole paragraph in Plover.
