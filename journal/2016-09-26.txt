Day 36 - 24:50
==============

15:00 - 35 WPM w/18 errors (96%).

15:00 - 33 WPM w/6 errors (98%).

Sweet.  It's finally time to move on.  More vowels?  Or more
consonants?

More vowels, I think.  Oh, and I should do a ten-minute session to
put myself back on even quarter hours.

15:00 - 36 WPM w/7 errors (98%).

Yeah, that feels solid. I should really aim for 98% accuracy. That
last little bit of accuracy makes all the difference in how
comfortable and solid it feels.

And sweet, I wrote that last paragraph in Plover!

10:00 - 39 WPM w/10 errors (97%).

And there was a *bunch* at the end that was faster: I was careful
through most of it and then it felt so good that I went cruising
through the last few minutes.

0:55 today, 25:45 total.
