Day 23 - 15:10
==============

15:00 - 1&2 key words and single-stroke CVC @ 27 WPM.

OK, this is starting to come back.

15:00 - 1&2 key words and single-stroke CVC @ 29 WPM.

Yeah, I think I just have to keep doing this until it's faster and
totally solid.  Right now it's feeling better and better, but I'm just
speeding up and still making maybe 25-35 errors in 15 minutes.  I should
probably get that down to one or two errors.

But it's starting to get kind of boring...maybe I could make some sort
of nonsense sentence or story generator?

15:00 - 1&2-key words and single-stroke CVC @ 32 WPM, but with lots of errors.

Yeah...I should have done this earlier.  I'm too tired to do it now.

10:00-ish - Thomas Thurman's Steno practice sentences.

(http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~tthurman/practice.html)

Yeah, that's very cool.  I need to do something like that.
