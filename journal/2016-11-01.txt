Day 65 (76) - 47:40
===================

18:00 Parrigues pg. 5 - 189 words @ 12 WPM.

Nice. That went really well.

35:00 Parrigues pg. 6 - 273 words @ 9 WPM.

And...ouch. That one had a whole bunch of words that aren't even
in the dictionary. "Scry", "coir", "snood", etc. Also some words
that are only briefed or that I don't know how to enter. "Int-"
words, for instance. Also things like "shadow" and
"characteristic". So I should drill some of those before I do
more.

And maybe I'll go drill a few minutes of words that I know to quit
on a good note. Let's see, I have 53 minutes today. So 7 minutes
will give me an hour.

7:00 - NGSL forms 200-400 @ 27 WPM.

1:00 today, 48:40 total.
